# ─── Temperature Logic (injected into GPT scoring prompt) ─────────────────────

TEMP_LOGIC = """
Determine lead temperature using these rules IN ORDER:

1. If prospect has NO valid motive or reason to sell → COLD (regardless of anything else)
2. If timeline is more than 1 year → NURTURE
3. If timeline is around 1 year → COLD
4. If timeline is ASAP to 3 months (soon):
   a. If AP < MV (or MV unknown but seller highly motivated) AND valid motive → HOT
   b. If AP > MV AND valid motive AND open to listing → WARM
   c. If AP > MV AND valid motive AND NOT open to listing → COLD

When MV is UNKNOWN, ALWAYS still pick the best concrete temperature from available
signals (motive strength, timeline, asking price reasonableness, seller attitude, open
to listing). NEVER return null and NEVER write the phrase "Preliminary — recalculate
after MV" into the template or anywhere else. The user will enter the MV afterward and
the app will recalculate automatically if needed.

Always add any information the prospect provided that does not fit an existing field into the Notes section.
